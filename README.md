## 🤓 How It Works

- Press any key
- JavaScript detects:
  - `e.key` → the actual key (e.g. "a", "Enter")
  - `e.code` → physical key location (e.g. "KeyA")
  - `e.key.charCodeAt(0)` → ASCII value
- The UI updates instantly using `innerHTML`

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Real-time event handling (`keydown`)
- Clean layout and animations with CSS
- Responsive design using rem, % and flexbox
- Deploying to GitHub Pages
